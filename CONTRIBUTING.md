# Contributing to Glitter Text
I've never gotten contributions on anything! But if you're interested in contributing, that would be very cool. I would love to hear about:
* bugs
* improvements
* new features
* fancier glitter texts
* anything else you're thinking

# Code of Conduct
I'm adopting the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct for this project.
