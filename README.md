# ✨Let's get glittery! ✨

Welcome to **Glitter Text**, a small Sinatra app for making glitter texts that I built in the Flatiron School's Online Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. (Read my quick blog post about it [here](https://chrissygonzalez.github.io/lets_get_glittery).) To install it, simply:
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Using your terminal, navigate to the folder that contains the app
3. Enter `bundle install` to install the various dependencies (you'll need Ruby 2.2.2 or higher)
4. Run the migrations by entering `rake db:migrate`
5. Seed the database by typing `rake db:seed`
6. Enter `shotgun` to start the server
7. Navigate to the URL shotgun gives you
8. Sign up for an account, and create some Glitter Texts!
